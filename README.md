## Overview
Our program is designed to help anyone looking to build muscle, whether they are completely new to exercise or experienced gym-goers seeking a fresh workout routine.
The program starts by asking the user about their experience level, allowing them to choose between beginner, intermediate, or professional. Next, the user is prompted to provide key information, including their age, height, weight, and goal weight.
Based on the input, the program generates a personalized workout plan that focuses on building muscle. The plan includes a detailed overview of exercises tailored to target specific muscle groups, such as back, legs, and more.
Additionally, the plan provides important guidance at the start, including recommendations on how many days of rest the user should take between workouts to optimize recovery and muscle growth.
This program ensures that anyone, regardless of their fitness level, can follow a structured, effective workout plan.
